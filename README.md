# 365scripts

## Why?

Have you ever caught yourself on wanting to discover some new branch of software? Yeah, me too.
That's why this project exists. I just want to sit everyday and write code that has __nothing__ 
to do with my work or serious business requirements. Just code, just scripts, just __fun__

Bash, Python, Rust, Perl and probably many more along this one 

## Rules

No rules, but it would be great if I was able to write 365 scripts in 365 days and learn something along the way.
If you find anything useful here feel free to use it on your own. I am taking inspiration from a lot of people myself
so it's all *good* :)
